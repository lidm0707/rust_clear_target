# Rust Target Cleaner Configuration
# Customize this file to control which paths to ignore and how the cleaner behaves

[ignore]
# Add directories to ignore during scanning, one per line
# Example:
# "/home/user/important_project"
# "/opt/rust/projects/production"
paths = []
[settings]
# Configure the behavior of the target cleaner

# Whether to run in dry-run mode by default (true = show what would be deleted, false = actually delete)
# It's recommended to keep this true until you're sure you want to delete files
dry_run = false

# Verbose output mode (true = show more details, false = concise)
# verbose = false

[access]
# Configure how target directories are evaluated based on access time

# How many days before considering a target directory as stale based on last access
# Default is 7 days, but you can adjust as needed
lastseen = 30
